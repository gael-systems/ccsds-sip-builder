ESA SIP Builder
---------------

The SIP Builder is an applicatio... to be continued

reading, writing and processing heterogeneous data. DRB API(r) is a software
abstract layer that helps developers programming applications as independently
as possible from the way data are encoded within files. Indeed, DRB API(r) is 
based on a uniform data model that makes the handling of supported data formats 
much easier. 

Programmed in Java and embedding W3C standards, DRB API(r) provides a portable 
solution that remains powerful even on large data collections. Initially developed 
and well-tried for accessing satellite imagery for European Space Agency, DRB API(r)
is the result of more than 15 years of expertise and know-how in data access 
programming. Thus, DRB API(r) provides a complete set of tools to solve simple and
complex data access issues with minimum engineering efforts.

DRB API(r) comes up with an XQuery engine that allows selecting and computing data
across targeted files. It also provides an XML Schema validation facility that runs 
over supported data. DRB API(r) embeds implementations for accessing local file
systems, HTTP and FTP remote servers and Jar, Tar or ZIP files. It also
includes implementations that accesses XML documents and binary files when
these last are described through XML Schema documents. Extra implementations
are available in DRB API(r) extensions or can be programmed by any developers.

DISTRIBUTION REPOSITORY
-----------------------

DRB API software distributions are made available from http://www.gael.fr/drb
Web site.


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS FOR API 
-----------------------------

FOR API USERS 

   - Java 1.5.0 SDK (http://java.sun.com) or higher installed on target machine 

FOR API CONTRIBUTORS

   - Java 1.5.0 SDK (http://java.sun.com)
   - Maven 2.x (http://www.maven.apache.org)
   - Internet connection if building plugins are not available in Maven local
     repository. 



BINARY INSTALLATION
-------------------

1. Download API binaries:

   drb-[M]-[m]-[t]-bin.tar.gz  or  drb-[M]-[m]-[t]-bin.zip

2. Extract archive content to the installation directory e.g. /usr/local/ for
   UNIX systems or c:\Program Files\ for Windows, etc.

3. Test installation. 


SOURCES INSTALLATION AND BUILDING
---------------------------------

1. Download API sources:

   drb-[M]-[m]-[t]-src.tar.gz  or  drb-[M]-[m]-[t]-src.zip

2. Extract archive content to the installation directory e.g. your home directory.

3. Move to the installation home directory in a command prompt environment e.g.
   DOS, or any UNIX terminal.

4. Build API Jar archive with the following command:

   mvn package

The previous command should have built DRB as drb-SNAPSHOT.jar file in a
"target" sub-directory. For further information on Maven building commands see
Maven (http://maven.apache.org)


TEST API INSTALLATION
---------------------

1. Test the installation by running the following command:

   java -jar [DRB_INSTALLATION_HOME]/lib/java/drb-[M]-[m]-[t].jar --version

2. For using DRB, configure your CLASSPATH or your IDE to reference the following
   Java Jar archive:

   [DRB_INSTALLATION_HOME]/lib/java/drb-[M]-[m]-[t].jar

3. It is not necessary to reference the dependencies accompanying the DRB Jar
   since it references them automatically.
