SIP Builder v${project.version}
------------------

The goal of the SIP Builder is to generate XFDU/SIP packages from input data
files and in conformance to a set of descriptors and constraints files
following the Producerâ€“Archive Interface Specification (PAIS) standard under
development of the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS).

The SIP Builder is an Open Source software aiming at verifying parts of the
PAIS standard, at serving as PAIS implementation alternative required for
the CCSDS recommendation process and, as far as possible, providing the PAIS
users with a handy tool for approaching the standard. The SIP Builder is a
prototype that should not be considered as an operational software. It may
change drastically from a version to another without special notification.
